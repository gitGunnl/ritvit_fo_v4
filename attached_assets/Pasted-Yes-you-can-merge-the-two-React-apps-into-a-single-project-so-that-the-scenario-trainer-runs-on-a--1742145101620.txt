Yes – you can merge the two React apps into a single project so that the scenario trainer runs on a specific route (for example, ritvit.fo/scenario-trainer). This approach involves combining the source code into one repository and then using a routing library (like React Router) to load the appropriate component based on the URL.

What to Do
Merge the Codebases:
• Move the files and folders for the scenario trainer into a new folder inside your main project (for instance, src/scenarioTrainer).
• Ensure that any asset paths, configuration files (like public/index.html or environment variables), and build settings (e.g., the homepage field in Create React App) are updated so that they work correctly from a subdirectory.

Set Up Routing:
• Install and configure React Router in your main project.
• Define a route (e.g., /scenario-trainer) that lazily loads or directly renders the scenario trainer’s component.
• This way, when users navigate to ritvit.fo/scenario-trainer, your app will display the merged scenario trainer module.

Optimize and Test:
• Use code splitting (with React’s lazy and Suspense) to ensure the extra code only loads when needed.
• Test all asset links and API calls to confirm they reference the correct base paths.

Example
Here’s a basic example using React Router:

jsx
Copy
// App.jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import ScenarioTrainer from './scenarioTrainer/ScenarioTrainer';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router basename="/">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route 
          path="/scenario-trainer/*" 
          element={<ScenarioTrainer />} 
        />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
And if your scenario trainer was originally a standalone app, you might need to adjust its internal links and asset paths (e.g., set PUBLIC_URL or use relative paths) so that they work correctly when served from /scenario-trainer.

Benefits
Unified Deployment: You only manage one deployment on your custom domain.
Improved SEO: Everything is on the same domain and you avoid cross-domain issues.
Better User Experience: Seamless navigation between your main page and the scenario trainer.
This method is often simpler than managing two separate deployments with a reverse proxy and lets you fully control the routing within a single React application.
