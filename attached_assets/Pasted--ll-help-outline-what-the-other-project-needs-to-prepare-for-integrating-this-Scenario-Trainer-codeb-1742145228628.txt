'll help outline what the other project needs to prepare for integrating this Scenario Trainer codebase. Here's what they need to do:

First, they need to ensure their project has all the required dependencies. They should add these to their package.json:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@radix-ui/react-accordion": "^1.2.1",
    "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.1.2",
    "@radix-ui/react-toast": "^1.2.2",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.60.5",
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.5.4",
    "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7"
  }
}
They need to configure their tailwind.config.js/ts to include the same color schemes and configurations we use. They should merge these settings into their existing Tailwind config:
{
  darkMode: ["class"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        background: "hsl(var(--background))",
        foreground: "hsl(var(--foreground))",
        card: {
          DEFAULT: "hsl(var(--card))",
          foreground: "hsl(var(--card-foreground))"
        },
        // ... other color configurations
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    require("tailwindcss-animate"),
    require("@tailwindcss/typography")
  ]
}
Set up their routing structure:
// In their main router file
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
const ScenarioTrainer = lazy(() => import('./scenarioTrainer/App'));
// In their routes configuration
{
  path: '/scenario-trainer/*',
  element: (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ScenarioTrainer />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
Prepare their project structure:
src/
  scenarioTrainer/  <-- This is where our code will go
  components/
  pages/
  ...rest of their existing structure
They need to ensure their Vite (or bundler) configuration can handle:
TypeScript
Path aliases (we use @/ for src)
CSS/PostCSS processing
Environment variables
Make sure they have the Google Sheets API configuration ready if they plan to use that functionality:
Google Cloud project set up
API credentials ready
Environment variables for Google authentication
That's what they need to prepare. Once ready, we can proceed with the actual migration of our code into their structure.

Let them know they should confirm once these preparations are complete, and we can then proceed with the actual file migration and integration.
